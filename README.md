Detecting malware based on dynamic analysis techniques it an efficient method. Traditional techniques, such as signature-based, would perform poorly on attempting to detect zero-day malwares, and it is also a tedious task to manually engineer malicious behaviors. There are several studies trying to automate this process. One of effective approaches introduced in recent years is to use graph to represent behaviors of an executable, and learn from these graphs. However, the graphs constructed are simple and still omit many important information. In this paper we present a method to represent malware as a multi-edge directional heterogeneous graph based on its behaviors collected from cuckoo sandbox, and apply a graph attention network to detect malware from collected datasets. Our approach gives the result of 92.66% accuracy, outperforms other methods.
